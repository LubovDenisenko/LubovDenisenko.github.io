        <h1>Getting started with TaxDome Help Center</h1>
        <p>
            In <a href="https://help.taxdome.com/" target="_blank">
                the Help Center</a>, you can find detailed articles that explain how to navigate the system, explore its
            features, and quickly find answers to any questions you may have.

        </p>

        <h2>How to find the article you need</h2>
        <p>On the Help Center’s homepage, you can search for information in two ways:</p>
        <h3>1. With a search bar</h3>
        <p>If you already know what you are looking for, type a few keywords into the search field. Then choose from the
            list the article you need.</p>

        <h3>2. Within folders</h3>
        <p>If you are not sure how to phrase your search or just want to explore the platform, choose a folder that
            interests you. Then open it and select an article from the list inside.</p>
